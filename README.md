# Sales-Processing-and-Distribution-System

This application was developed using Microsoft Visual C# 2005, Crystal Reports 9 and Microsoft Access Database as the final year project of my Higher Diploma. SellIt â€“ Sales Processing and Distribution System was developed as a prototype system for Mosfly International.

The system has many features from user management, sales and order management to reporting and database backups.
